## Variables, Data Types & More

### 1\. Using The Console

The console is your most important tool. It's a window into your code, letting you see what's happening, check values, and find bugs.

  * `console.log()`: This is how you "print" or "log" a value. You will use this *constantly* to check your work.

    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello, student!");

    let age = 25;
    console.log(age); // Prints: 25

    // You can log multiple things at once:
    console.log("My age is:", age, "and that is true.");
    // Prints: My age is: 25 and that is true.
    ```

  * `console.table()`: A "hidden gem." If you have an array or an object, this prints it in a clean, easy-to-read table.

    ```javascript
    const users = [
      { name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
      { name: 'Bob', age: 22 }
    ];
    console.table(users);
    // This will show a nice table in your console
    ```

  * `console.error()` & `console.warn()`: These are for showing important messages.

    ```javascript
    console.error("This is a major error!"); // Shows in red
    console.warn("This is a friendly warning."); // Shows in yellow
    ```

### 2\. Comments: Writing Notes in Code

Comments are notes for you and other humans. The JavaScript engine completely ignores them.

  * **Single-Line Comment:** Starts with `//`. It comments out the rest of the line.
  * **Multi-Line Comment:** Starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`. It comments out everything in between.

**Why use comments?** To explain the "why," not the "what."

```javascript
// ❌ Bad Comment (We can read the code and see this)
// This is a variable for the user's name
let userName = 'Sarah';

// ✅ Good Comment (This explains WHY something is happening)
// We add 1.1 because the 10% tax is a business requirement
let finalPrice = basePrice * 1.1;

/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  I can use it to temporarily disable
  a whole block of code while I test something.
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x);
*/
```

### 3\. Variables: `let`, `const`, and `var`

A variable is a "storage container" or "box" for a piece of data. You give it a name (a label) so you can refer to it later.

#### `let`: The Changeable Box

Use `let` when you know the value will need to change.

```javascript
// 1. Declare the box
let score;
console.log(score); // Prints: undefined (the box is empty)

// 2. Assign a value to the box
score = 100;
console.log(score); // Prints: 100

// 3. Re-assign (change) the value
score = 150;
console.log(score); // Prints: 150
```

#### `const`: The "Constant" Box

Use `const` when you know the value should **never** be changed (re-assigned). This is the default choice for modern JavaScript.

  * It **must** be given a value when it's declared.
  * It **cannot** be re-assigned.

<!-- end list -->

```javascript
const birthYear = 1995;
console.log(birthYear); // Prints: 1995

// Now, try to change it:
// birthYear = 1996; // ❌ TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
// This error is a GOOD thing. It protects you from bugs.

// This also fails (you can't declare an empty const):
// const gravity; // ❌ SyntaxError: Missing initializer
```

#### `var`: The Old Way (Avoid It\!)

You will see `var` in old code. You should avoid using it. Why? Because it has confusing "scope" rules.

  * **`let` and `const` are "Block Scoped"**
    They only exist inside the `{...}` (a block) they are declared in. This is logical and easy to understand.

    ```javascript
    if (true) {
      let x = 10;
      const y = 20;
      console.log(x, y); // 10, 20 (They exist in here)
    }

    // console.log(x, y); // ❌ ReferenceError: x is not defined
    // They "die" outside the { } block. This is good!
    ```

  * **`var` is "Function Scoped"**
    It "leaks" out of blocks, which can cause bugs.

    ```javascript
    if (true) {
      var z = 30;
      console.log(z); // 30 (Exists in here)
    }

    console.log(z); // 30 (It "leaked" out! This is confusing and bad)
    ```

**Rule:** Always use `const`. If you know you need to change the value, use `let`. Never use `var`.

-----

### 4\. Primitive vs. Reference Types (The Most Critical Concept)

This is the most important topic in this guide. Understanding this will save you from hundreds of future bugs.

JavaScript has two main categories of data types.

#### A) Primitive Types (Stored "By Value")

These are the simple, basic building blocks of data.
**The Primitives:** `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `Symbol`, `BigInt`.

  * **Analogy:** Think of a primitive as a **piece of paper** with a value written on it (e.g., the number `10`).
  * When you copy a primitive, you get a **new, separate piece of paper** with the same value copied onto it. They are completely independent.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// 'a' is a piece of paper with '10' written on it
let a = 10;

// 'b' is a NEW piece of paper. We copy the value from 'a' onto 'b'.
let b = a;

console.log("a:", a); // a: 10
console.log("b:", b); // b: 10

// Now, we change the value on paper 'a'
a = 20;

// Does this change 'b'? No! 'b' is a separate piece of paper.
console.log("--- after change ---");
console.log("a:", a); // a: 20
console.log("b:", b); // b: 10 (still 10)
```

#### B) Reference Types (Stored "By Reference")

These are the complex, structural data types.
**The Reference Types:** `Object {}`, `Array []`, `Function`.

  * **Analogy:** Think of a reference type as a **house**. The variable doesn't hold the *house*, it holds the *home address* on a piece of paper.
  * When you copy a reference type, you get a **new piece of paper**, but you just copy the **same home address** onto it. Both variables now point to the *exact same house*.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// 'person1' holds the ADDRESS to a house (object)
let person1 = { name: "Alice" };

// 'person2' is a NEW variable, but we copy the SAME ADDRESS into it
let person2 = person1;

console.log("person1:", person1.name); // person1: Alice
console.log("person2:", person2.name); // person2: Alice

// Now, we use the address in 'person2' to go to the house and change something
person2.name = "Bob";

// Let's check 'person1' again...
console.log("--- after change ---");
console.log("person1:", person1.name); // person1: Bob (It changed!)
console.log("person2:", person2.name); // person2: Bob

// Why? Because both variables pointed to the SAME house.
// You changed the house, and they both see the change.
```

-----

### 5\. Mutable vs. Immutable (A "Can It Be Changed?" Story)

This is directly related to the topic above.

  * **Immutable (CANNOT be changed):** All **Primitive Types** are immutable.
    You cannot change a primitive value. You can only replace it with a *new* one.

    **The String "Trap":** This confuses all beginners. Methods like `.toUpperCase()` do **not** change the original string. They **return a new string**.

    ```javascript
    let myName = "alex";

    myName.toUpperCase(); // This does nothing to myName!
    console.log(myName); // "alex" (It did not change!)

    // To "change" it, you must catch the new string it returns:
    let newName = myName.toUpperCase();
    console.log(newName); // "ALEX"

    // Or re-assign it back to the original variable:
    myName = myName.toUpperCase();
    console.log(myName); // "ALEX"
    ```

  * **Mutable (CAN be changed):** All **Reference Types** are mutable.
    You can change the "contents" of an object or array without creating a new one.

    **The `const` "Trap":** This is the *second* most confusing part for beginners.
    `const` does **NOT** make an object's contents unchangeable.
    `const` only means the **variable cannot be re-assigned** (it can't be given a *new* address).

    ```javascript
    // We create a user. The variable 'user' holds an
    // address to this object, and that address is CONSTANT.
    const user = { name: "David", age: 40 };

    // ✅ This is fine! We are not changing the address.
    // We are going *to* the address and changing the house.
    user.age = 41;
    user.city = "New York";
    console.log(user); // { name: "David", age: 41, city: "New York" }

    // ❌ This will fail! We are trying to give the
    // 'user' variable a NEW address (a new object).
    // user = { name: "Dan" }; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    ```

-----

### 6\. Type Conversion (Explicit)

This is when **you** (the developer) manually change a value's type.

  * **To a Number:** `Number(value)`

    ```javascript
    let strValue = "25";
    let numValue = Number(strValue);
    console.log(numValue); // 25 (as a number)

    let badStr = "hello";
    let nanValue = Number(badStr);
    console.log(nanValue); // NaN (Not a Number)
    ```

  * **To a String:** `String(value)`

    ```javascript
    let num = 100;
    let str = String(num);
    console.log(str); // "100" (as a string)
    ```

  * **To a Boolean:** `Boolean(value)`
    This is simple. You just need to memorize the **6 "Falsy" Values**. Everything else is `true`.

    **The 6 Falsy Values:**

    1.  `false`
    2.  `0`
    3.  `""` (empty string)
    4.  `null`
    5.  `undefined`
    6.  `NaN`

    <!-- end list -->

    ```javascript
    console.log(Boolean(0)); // false
    console.log(Boolean(null)); // false
    console.log(Boolean("")); // false

    // Everything else is truthy!
    console.log(Boolean("hello")); // true
    console.log(Boolean("0")); // true (this is not an empty string!)
    console.log(Boolean(50)); // true
    console.log(Boolean([])); // true (even an empty array is truthy!)
    console.log(Boolean({})); // true (even an empty object is truthy!)
    ```

-----

### 7\. Type Coercion (Implicit)

This is when **JavaScript** automatically changes types for you, often in confusing ways.

  * **The `+` Operator Trap:** If `+` sees a string, it becomes a "concatenation" (joining) operator, not a math operator.

    ```javascript
    console.log(10 + 10);   // 20
    console.log("10" + 10); // "1010" (10 was coerced to "10")
    console.log(10 + "10"); // "1010"
    ```

  * **The Math Operators (`-`, `*`, `/`) Magic:** These operators *always* try to do math, so they coerce strings into numbers.

    ```javascript
    console.log("20" - 10); // 10 ( "20" was coerced to 20)
    console.log("20" * 2);  // 40
    console.log("hello" - 5); // NaN (Number("hello") is NaN)
    ```

  * **The `==` vs. `===` Golden Rule**

      * `==` (Loose Equality): **Performs type coercion**. It's unpredictable. **Avoid it.**
      * `===` (Strict Equality): **Does NOT coerce**. It checks if the type AND value are the same. **Always use this.**

    <!-- end list -->

    ```javascript
    console.log(10 == "10"); // true (Bad! JS coerced the string)
    console.log(10 === "10"); // false (Good! number is not a string)

    console.log(0 == false); // true (Bad! JS coerced false to 0)
    console.log(0 === false); // false (Good! number is not a boolean)
    ```

**Your \#1 Rule:** **Always use `===` for comparison.**

### 8\. Working With Strings

Strings are primitives, but they have many powerful built-in properties and methods.

  * `let s = "Hello, World!";`

  * `.length`: A property that tells you the length.
    `console.log(s.length); // 13`

  * `.toUpperCase()` / `.toLowerCase()`: Returns a new string in that case.
    `console.log(s.toUpperCase()); // "HELLO, WORLD!"`

  * `.trim()`: Returns a new string with whitespace removed from the *start and end*.
    `let messy = "   hello   ";`
    `console.log(messy.trim()); // "hello"`

  * `.slice(startIndex, endIndex)`: Extracts a piece of the string. The `endIndex` is *not* included.
    `console.log(s.slice(0, 5)); // "Hello" (chars 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)`
    `console.log(s.slice(7)); // "World!" (from index 7 to the end)`

  * `.split(separator)`: Splits a string into an `Array` of smaller strings.
    `let fruits = "apple,banana,orange";`
    `let fruitArray = fruits.split(",");`
    `console.log(fruitArray); // ["apple", "banana", "orange"]`

  * **Template Literals (The "Backtick" Strings)**
    This is the modern, easy way to combine strings and variables. Use backticks (`` ` ``) instead of quotes.

    ```javascript
    const name = "Elena";
    const userScore = 85;

    // Old, hard way:
    const oldGreeting = "Hello, " + name + "! Your score is " + userScore + ".";

    // New, easy way (Template Literals):
    const newGreeting = `Hello, ${name}! Your score is ${userScore}.`;

    console.log(newGreeting); // "Hello, Elena! Your score is 85."
    ```

-----

### 9\. Working With Numbers & The `Math` Object

These are helpers for doing math.

  * `.toFixed(digits)`: Formats a number to a specific number of decimal places. **Important:** It returns a `String`.

    ```javascript
    let price = 19.99123;
    console.log(price.toFixed(2)); // "19.99" (Useful for money)
    ```

  * **The `Math` Object:** A built-in object for math operations.

      * `Math.round(value)`: Standard rounding.
        `console.log(Math.round(4.7)); // 5`
        `console.log(Math.round(4.2)); // 4`
      * `Math.floor(value)`: **Rounds down** to the nearest integer.
        `console.log(Math.floor(4.9)); // 4`
      * `Math.ceil(_value_)`: **Rounds up** to the nearest integer.
        `console.log(Math.ceil(4.1)); // 5`
      * `Math.random()`: Returns a random decimal between 0 and 1 (but not including 1).
      * **Formula for a random whole number:** This is a classic.
        // Get a random number between 1 and 100
        `let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;`
        `console.log(random);`

-----

### 10\. Dates & Times

Dates are notoriously tricky in all languages. Here are the basics.

  * `new Date()`: Creates a `Date` object for the current, local date and time.
    `const now = new Date();`
    `console.log(now);`

  * **The Date "Month" Trap (CRITICAL DETAIL\!):**
    Months are **0-indexed**\! `0 = January`, `1 = February`, ... `11 = December`.

    ```javascript
    // new Date(year, monthIndex, day)
    // To create Christmas 2025:
    const christmas = new Date(2025, 11, 25);
    console.log(christmas);
    ```

  * **Getting Parts of a Date:**

    ```javascript
    const today = new Date();
    console.log(today.getFullYear()); // e.g., 2025
    console.log(today.getMonth());    // e.g., 9 (for October, because it's 0-indexed)
    console.log(today.getDate());     // e.g., 30 (the day of the month)
    ```

  * **Easy Formatting:**
    `toLocaleDateString()` formats the date in a way that makes sense for the user's local region (e.g., `MM/DD/YYYY` in the US, `DD/MM/YYYY` in the UK).

    ```javascript
    const today = new Date();
    console.log(today.toLocaleDateString()); // e.g., "10/30/2025"
    ```
